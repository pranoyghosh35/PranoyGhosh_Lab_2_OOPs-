# PranoyGhosh_Lab_2_OOPs
This is my solution towards the Great Learning OOPS Lab 2 assignment. We need to design an end to end system which take orders for Pizza, Pasta
from customer and reports to kitchen where if the order is valid based on available options it will prep the meal and system reports to customer with details,prices and request customer to make payment. Here power of OOPs in Java has been demonstrated through implementation of two different classes, constructor overloading, creation of new objects with distinct values corresponding to order etc.
